        <p>The Sunset Cafe is an artistic and digital interaction setting that allows the viewer to generate random pastries and interact with the fictional environment. The concept and design of the work is based around a distant childhood memory I have, which is of going to a cafe with my sister, Allie. Hence, why the employee is named Allie. The creative work is meant to instill a relaxed, warm, and gentle vibe into the viewer. </p>
